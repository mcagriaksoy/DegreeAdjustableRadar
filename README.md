Zynq ZedBoard SoC Lecture Final Project, degree adjustable ultrasonic sensor application

# Abstract
In this project, distance measurement is done by ultrasonic distance sensor and servo motor. With the motor position which can be controlled from the software part, the distance in the desired position can be measured.

# Introduction
In this project, HC-SR04 Sensors and servo motor will be controlled with Zedboard. Our aim is to get 180 degree data and push to user interface via UART. During this project, ADC (Analog to Digital Converters) will be investigated, sensor electronics and communication methods will be learnt. Ultrasonic sonar sensors are using measure distance 12cm to 60cm. Itâ€™s very cheap sensor and very easy to use. With many purposes of HC-SR04 module, 180 degree point of view can be obtained and measure distance of some obstacles easily. Servo motors are used for precise angle changes. In this scenario, servo is used for scan area with sonar module. It turns desired angle, after that thanks to sonar sensor the system measure the distance at each angle.
